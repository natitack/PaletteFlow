# PaletteFlow
PaletteFlow is a tool developed by students at OSU-Cascades in collaboration with fare*well, designed to streamline the client onboarding process for customers building a website. Its primary objective is to provide an intuitive platform that assists clients in establishing a preliminary brand identity, enabling a faster start to site development. PaletteFlow guides users through the selection of an initial color and brand archetype, leveraging this information to generate an accessible color palette and site theme. Users can further customize their theme, and PaletteFlow produces a branding document that can be exported as a PDF.

# How to Modify

## Adding New Relume Components

PaletteFlow supports modular addition of new Relume hero and feature components. Code for these components can be copied directly from the Relume website. To add a new Relume component (such as a hero or feature layout), follow these steps:

1. **Create the Component**

   - Copy the component code from the Relume website and save it as a `.tsx` file.
   - Place your new component file in the appropriate directory:
     - Hero components: `/components/heroelements/`
     - Feature components: `/components/featureelelemts/`

2. **Register the Component**

   - For hero components, edit `/components/heroelements/RelumeHeroWrapper.tsx` and add your new component to the `heroLayouts` map.
   - For feature components, edit `/components/featureelelemts/RelumeFeatureWrapper.tsx` and add your new component to the `featureLayouts` map.


3. **Add Preview Images**

   - Remember to add a PNG preview image of your layout to the associated public directory:
     - Hero: `/public/images/previews/hero/`
     - Feature: `/public/images/previews/feature/`
   - Name the image file to match your layout key (e.g., `header99.png`).
   - Preview images are required for all new layouts to ensure they appear correctly in the deliverable export.

**Summary:**  
- Create your component in the correct folder (copy from Relume if needed).  
- Register it in the wrapper (`RelumeHeroWrapper` or `RelumeFeatureWrapper`).  
- Add a preview image for deliverables (required).

## Adding New Fonts

PaletteFlow allows you to easily add new Google Fonts for users to select. To add a new font option:

1. **Import the Font**

   - Open `/hooks/useFontOptions.ts`.
   - Import your desired font from `next/font/google`. For example:
     ```typescript
     import { Lato } from "next/font/google";
     ```

2. **Initialize the Font**

   - Create a font instance with the required options:
     ```typescript
     const lato = Lato({ subsets: ["latin"], weight: "400" });
     ```

3. **Add to Font Options**

   - Add your new font to the `fontOptions` array:
     ```typescript
     { value: lato.className, label: "Lato" },
     ```

4. **Update Global Font Variables**

   - Open `/pages/_app.js`.
   - Import your new font at the top:
     ```javascript
     import { Lato } from "next/font/google";
     ```
   - Initialize the font:
     ```javascript
     const lato = Lato({ subsets: ['latin'], weight: "400" });
     ```
   - Add a CSS variable for your font in the `<style jsx global>` block:
     ```css
     --font-lato: ${lato.style.fontFamily};
     ```
   - (Optional) Set as default in `body` if desired.

5. **Use in the Font Picker**

   - The new font will automatically appear in the font selection dropdown in the UI (e.g., in the FontStep component).
   

**Summary:**  
- Import the font in `/hooks/useFontOptions.ts` and `/pages/_app.js`.
- Initialize it and add it to the `fontOptions` array.
- Add a CSS variable for the font in `_app.js` for global use.
- The font will be available for users to select in the app.

## Updating the Mood Step

The Mood Step in PaletteFlow allows users to select a brand personality, which automatically sets related style options such as font, button style, and color mood. To update or add new moods, follow these steps:

1. **Open the MoodStep Component**

   - Edit the file: `/components/steps/MoodStep.tsx`.

2. **Modify the MOOD_CONFIG Object**

   - Locate the `MOOD_CONFIG` constant at the top of the file.
   - To **add a new mood**, add a new entry to the object with a unique key. Each mood should include:
     - `label`: Display name
     - `emoji`: Emoji icon
     - `description`: Short description
     - `styles`: An object with the following properties:
       - `font`: The label of a font from your font options (e.g., `"Nunito"`)
       - `buttonStyle`: Button style string (e.g., `"medium"`)
       - `heroLayout`: Hero layout key (e.g., `"header1"`)
       - `featureLayout`: Feature layout key (e.g., `"layout398"`)
       - `chroma`: Chroma value (number, e.g., `0.30`)
       - `lightness`: Lightness value (number, e.g., `0.90`)

   - Example:
     ```typescript
     newmood: {
       label: "New Mood",
       emoji: "ðŸŒŸ",
       description: "Energetic, fresh, unique",
       styles: {
         font: "Nunito",
         buttonStyle: "medium",
         heroLayout: "header1",
         featureLayout: "layout398",
         chroma: 0.50,
         lightness: 0.75
       }
     }
     ```

   - To **edit an existing mood**, update its properties as needed.

3. **Ensure Font Mapping**

   - The `font` property in each moodâ€™s `styles` should match the `label` of a font in your `/hooks/useFontOptions.ts` file.

4. **Save and Test**

   - Save your changes. The new or updated mood will appear in the Mood Step UI, and selecting it will update the brandâ€™s style settings accordingly.

**Summary:**  
- Edit `MOOD_CONFIG` in `/components/steps/MoodStep.tsx` to add or update moods.
- Use font labels that exist in your font options.
- Save and test the Mood Step in the app.

## Adding and Referencing New Fields in Choices Context

PaletteFlow uses a global Choices Context (`/context/ChoicesContext.tsx`) to store user selections such as color, font, mood, and more. If you want to add a new field (for example, `backgroundPattern` or `logoShape`) to the context and use it throughout the app, follow these steps:

### 1. Add the Field to the ChoicesState Interface

Open `/context/ChoicesContext.tsx` and update the `ChoicesState` interface to include your new field:

```typescript
interface ChoicesState {
  // ...existing fields...
  backgroundPattern: string; // <-- Add your new field here
}
```

### 2. Add the Field to the Initial State

In the `getInitialChoices` function, add a default value for your new field:

```typescript
return {
  // ...existing fields...
  backgroundPattern: "dots", // <-- Default value for new field
};
```


### 3. Reference or Update the Field in Components

To **read** the value in a component:

```typescript
import { useChoices } from "@/context/ChoicesContext";

const { choices } = useChoices();
console.log(choices.backgroundPattern); // Access the value
```

To **update** the value:

```typescript
const { updateChoice } = useChoices();
updateChoice("backgroundPattern", "stripes");
```

### 4.  Add to setAllChoices

If you use `setAllChoices`, ensure your new field is included in any objects passed to it.

---

**Summary:**  
- Add your field to `ChoicesState` and the initial state.
- Migrate old data if needed.
- Use `choices.<field>` to read, and `updateChoice("<field>", value)` to update.
- Update any UI or logic to use the new field.

This ensures your new field is globally available and persists across sessions.

## Adding a New Step to the Brand Builder

To add a new step (such as a new design choice or configuration) to the Brand Builder flow in PaletteFlow, follow these steps:

### 1. Create Your Step Component

- Create a new file for your step in `/components/steps/`, e.g. `NewStep.tsx`.
- Export a React component that accepts `value` and `onChange` props.
- Example:
  ```tsx
  // filepath: /components/steps/NewStep.tsx
  import { Flex, Text } from "@radix-ui/themes";

  export function NewStep({ value, onChange }) {
    return (
      <Flex direction="column" gap="4">
        <Text size="5" weight="bold">Choose your new option</Text>
        {/* Your UI here */}
      </Flex>
    );
  }
  ```

### 2. Add the Field to Choices Context

- Add a new field to the `ChoicesState` interface in `/context/ChoicesContext.tsx`.
- Add a default value for your field in the `getInitialChoices` function.
- Example:
  ```typescript
  // filepath: /context/ChoicesContext.tsx
  interface ChoicesState {
    // ...existing fields...
    newField: string; // <-- Add your new field
  }

  // In getInitialChoices:
  return {
    // ...existing fields...
    newField: "", // <-- Default value
  };
  ```

### 3. Register the Step in the Brand Builder

- Open `/pages/brand-builder.tsx`.
- Add your new step to the `STEPS` array, specifying a unique `id`, your component, and a title.
- Example:
  ```typescript
  // filepath: /pages/brand-builder.tsx
  import { NewStep } from "../components/steps/NewStep";

  const STEPS = [
    // ...existing steps...
    { id: "newField", component: NewStep, title: "New Step Title" },
  ];
  ```

### 4. (Optional) Update the Live Preview

- If your new step affects the live preview, update the `LivePreview` component to use the new field from `choices`.

### 5. (Optional) Update Deliverables

- If your new field should appear in exported documents or deliverables, update the relevant export logic to include it.

# Known Issues, Future Improvements

- Mood overrides can interfere with low-saturation colors
- Font Picker needs real-time previews  
- App is not mobile-friendly
  
- Inspiration step (client request) needs to be designed 
- Moodstep options need more meaningful differentiation  
- Additional Relume components should be added  
- Deliverable design requires visual polish  
 

# Troubleshooting
Here are some common issues you might encounter while running or modifying PaletteFlow, along with suggested fixes:

## App Doesnâ€™t Start or Shows Errors on Launch
Symptom: npm run dev or yarn dev fails with errors.

Fixes:

Make sure you're using Node.js version 18 or later.

Run rm -rf node_modules && npm install to clear and reinstall dependencies.

Check that your .env file (if applicable) is correctly configured.

## New Component or Step Doesnâ€™t Show Up
Symptom: Custom hero/feature layout or a new builder step doesnâ€™t appear in the UI.

Fixes:

Confirm youâ€™ve correctly imported and registered the component in the appropriate wrapper (RelumeHeroWrapper.tsx, RelumeFeatureWrapper.tsx, or the STEPS array).

Ensure your component file is located in the correct folder (/heroelements/, /featureelelemts/, or /steps/).

Check for typos in layout keys or missing preview image files.

## Font Doesnâ€™t Appear in Dropdown
Symptom: Added a Google Font but itâ€™s not selectable in the UI.

Fixes:

Ensure the font is imported and instantiated in /hooks/useFontOptions.ts.

Make sure the label in the font config matches the label used in any mood configurations.

## Exported PDF Missing Previews or Styles
Symptom: Branding PDF shows empty blocks or missing images.

Fixes:

Verify that preview images are added to the correct directory (/public/images/previews/hero/ or /feature/) and that file names match layout keys.

Ensure all required fields in Choices Context are set before export.

## UI Looks Broken on Smaller Screens
Symptom: Layout issues or components overlap on mobile.

Fix: PaletteFlow is not currently optimized for mobile. Responsive design improvements are tracked in the Known Issues section.

# Architectural & Refactor Plans

As PaletteFlow matures, several architectural improvements will support better scalability, maintainability, and potential client integration:

- **Naming Standardization**  
  Folder and component names are currently inconsistent (e.g., inconsistent use of snake case, camel case, and kebab case). Standardizing naming conventions across the codebase will reduce cognitive load and make onboarding easier for new developers.

- **Backend Integration (Database or Cloud Services)**  
  At present, PaletteFlow operates entirely on the client side. Incorporating a backendâ€”whether via a cloud database (e.g. Firebase, Supabase) or API-based storageâ€”would enable persistent user sessions, saving progress, and versioned deliverables. This is especially critical if the tool evolves into a client portal.

- **Collaboration with fare*well Architecture**  
  To ensure seamless integration with fare*wellâ€™s future client workflows, we recommend aligning the architecture of PaletteFlow with fare*wellâ€™s existing systems and preferences. This could involve standardizing component structure, design tokens, or export formats to match their site-building tools and pipelines.
